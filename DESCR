All AWS service exceptions are raised by boto3 as a
botocore.exceptions.ClientError, with the contents of the exception
indicating what kind of exception happened. This is not very pythonic,
and the contents themselves are rather opaque, most being held in dicts
rather than as properties. The functions in this package help dealing
with that, to make your code less verbose and require less memorization
of ClientError contents.
